# PHP Markdown Extra package [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/alexfornuto/language-phpMarkdownExtra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atom/language-gfm)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to [PHP MarkDown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
files in Atom.

This is a fork of the Github Flavored Markdown language pack, that I hope to modify it to work with the features of PHP Markdown Extra. I have yet to find a syntax hilighter for PME for Atom, TextMate, Sublime, or any other text editor, so despite having never attemtped a project like this before, I've decided to try to make one myself.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, or **anything** else you can offer to help get this thing off the ground.
